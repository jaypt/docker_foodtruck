# docker_foodtruck
Trying out the popular sf food truck exercise which has been solved by many before. I looked out at the various solutions available online and came up with my own version.

#1)run 'docker-compose up' after cloning this repo.
#2)it starts and runs 2 containers, one for elastic search and another for flask.
#3) curl '0.0.0.0:5001' displays the index.html
#4) curl'0.0.0.0:5001/search?food=chicken' gives link for map with food trucks that serve chicken.
